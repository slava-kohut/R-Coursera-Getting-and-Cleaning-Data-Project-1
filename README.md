# Getting and Cleaning Data: Project 1 
---

This repository was created as part of the project for *Getting and Cleaning Data*.
It contains the following files:

1. *run-analysis.R*
2. *CodeBook.md*
3. *tidy-data.txt*
4. *README.md*

*run-analysis.R* is a script that does data processing for the project. 
It takes the data for the project (in the folder *UCI HAR dataset* produced by unpacking the archive), performs all required operation to collect the data and clean it up, and assembles a tidy data set *tidy-data.txt* with averages of all variables for each subject and activity.
*CodeBook.md* is a code book that describes all the variables and operations used for data manipulation in the script. 
The output produced by running the script when the data are located in the working directory is the file *tidy-data.txt*.
